TESS FPE SPICE simulations

In most cases, the top level schematic for a test is "test.sch". "make test" will build all of the circuit files required and load them into ngspice. In some cases, this will trigger a simulation run, while in others you'll need to command what you want interactively.

Some of these are "test fixtures" for subsystem schematics in ../Schematics. In those cases, the Makefile makes copies of the source schematics in the Simulation directory. This is convenient if you want to make an experimental change.

Some useful things to "make":

FilterTest		Frequency/transient response of power input filters.
ParallelRegStress	Behavior of parallel regulator versus load.
ParallelStress		Parallel clocks at unreasonable operationg conditions
	 		(interactive).
parallelstress.txt	Parallel clocks at unreasonable operationg conditions
			(scripted series at different clock frequencies).
ParallelTest		"Normal" behavior of parallel clocks.
RegReg			Check PSRR of LM6142-based voltage regulators
SerialTest		"Normal" behavior of serial clocks
SerialStress		Serial clocks at unreasonable operationg conditions
PumpTest		Test charge pump that makes high voltages
BoosterTest		Test parallel clock booster circuit
ChainNoise		Static noise in measurement chain
ChainTest		Clocked measurement chain
AP			Artix power regulators, "normal" conditions.
APSC			Artix power regulators, short circuited outputs.

And, of course, "make clean" cleans up temporary files.
