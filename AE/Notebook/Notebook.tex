\section*{6/9/2015 Stress Simulations of Parallel Drivers}
We have promised that the drivers will be immune to bad sequencer programming. The hazard is that at unusually high clock frequencies and duty cycles the dissipation will be too high.

Since the driver voltage regulators implement current and dissipation limits, they are not the first concern. Each regulator powers the six drivers for a single CCD, so the worst case is rapid clocking of a single driver, focusing all of the available power on a few components. The voltage swing also matters: I am assuming we will soon restict that to 10V.

The files for these sims are from commit 89d13541bd. The simulated ParallelReg and ParallelPair schematics are in AE/Simulation/Annex. They have added current monitors and do not exactly correspond to any revision of the mainline schematics. They suggest important revisions: see below. To reproduce this result

\begin{verbatim}
cd tess/AE/Simulationcp Annex/ParallelPair.sch Annex/ParallelReg.sch .
make parallelstress.txt\end{verbatim}

It'll make lots of SPICE spewage an your screen. Here's the result in parallelstress.txt:

The Booster robustly prevents overlap conduction between Q1 and Q2 (and the regulator is current-limited anyway), so these are not needed. They actually dissipated very little. The output waveforms are cleaner without them. R7 in the boosters is 365$\Omega$, up from 200$\Omega$ in FPE-6.1-RR9, slowing the rise times and reducing its dissipation. The CCD model is a lumped-constant approximation to the distributed parallel clock resistance/capacitance, with parameters adjusted to match Jerry's measurements of 5.1 driver waveforms. 

R7 remains the most problematic component, dissipating over 1/4W at the maximum clock frequency. It is a 1/10W component that really needs to be 1/2W.

For the Booster transistors, maximum dissipation is about 1/2W for Q1. Q2 is a bit less. According to the IR data sheets, these have thermal resistance junction to the PC board of 26C/W, so that's not a large temperature rise.

The regulator transistors Q1 and Q2 are thermally protected, and probably close to their limits at periods $\approx3\mu$s, so the actual power dissipation at periods in that range may be lower.
